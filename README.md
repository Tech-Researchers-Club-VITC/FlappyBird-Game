# Flappy_bird Game

Welcome to the Gesture-Controlled FlapprBird game repository! This unique and entertaining game combines the classic Flappy Bird concept with cutting-edge gesture control using the Mediapipe library. Say goodbye to tapping your screen or keyboard â€“ now you can control your bird's flight with hand gestures!
This game was created with the aid of ChatGPT using sophisticated prompt engineering techniques.
Features:

Gesture Control: Instead of traditional controls, this game lets you navigate your bird using your hand gestures captured by your webcam. Raise your hand to make the bird fly higher and lower it to descend.

High Score Tracking: Challenge yourself to beat your highest score! The game keeps track of your high score and displays it on the screen, motivating you to improve.

Interactive Main Menu: Start the game from an interactive main menu. It provides clear instructions on how to begin and showcases the high score to keep you competitive.

Pause Functionality: Need a break? Just press 'p' during the game to pause and resume whenever you're ready to continue the challenge.

Engaging Visuals and Sounds: The game features captivating visuals, including a main menu with dynamic background and a game over screen. Enjoy the audio effects with main menu music and a game over sound to enhance your gaming experience.

Warning for Multiple Gestures: To ensure fair gameplay, the game provides a warning if it detects multiple hand gestures, preventing unintended movements.

High Score Persistence: Your high score is stored in a text file, so you can track your progress across multiple gaming sessions.

Easy Setup: Get started quickly with easy setup instructions and dependencies listed in the README file.
